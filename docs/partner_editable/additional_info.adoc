== Post-deployment steps
. When deployment completes, go to the CodePipeline console, choose the pipeline created by the Quick Start, and review the steps.
. Navigate to the Amazon ECS Task updated by the pipeline, expand the container details and navigate to the URL for the application, and confirm that your application sample is deployed from GitHub.
. Modify the sample application code of your forked GitHub repository, and check in the changes. You will see that CodePipeline starts the CI/CD process and deploys the latest code changes to the ECS service.
