This Quick Start provides an end-to-end automated CI/CD environment. This solution will benefit organizations that want to automate their .NET application release pipelines. It provides fully managed and reliable application updates using AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy. Whenever code is modified within a specified GitHub repository branch, the deployment pipeline automatically launches an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance in the default Amazon virtual private cloud (VPC) to build a container image, and updates the configured Amazon ECS service task definition, initiating a release.

After deploying the Quick Start, you can use it to:

* Fetch the latest source code from GitHub and save it to a source artifact store.
* Automatically build the application.
* Deploy the application to the target environment.
