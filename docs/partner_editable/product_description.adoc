This Quick Start deploys a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud for containerized .NET applications on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS).

A code change to the configured GitHub repository branch initiates a build of a new Docker container image on a temporary Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. The pipeline then updates the configured Amazon ECS task definition, initiating the release of your updated application. This approach to continuous deployment is entirely serverless and uses managed services for the orchestration, build, and deployment of your software.

After deploying the Quick Start, you can use it to:

* Fetch the latest source code from GitHub and save it to a source artifact store.
* Automatically build the application.
* Deploy the application to the target environment.
