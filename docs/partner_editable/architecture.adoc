image::../images/dotnetfx-ecs-cicd-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* AWS CodePipeline to create a pipeline with source, build, and deploy stages. CodePipeline polls the configured GitHub repository and initiates a new pipeline run for each new commit. Each new build is retrieved from the source code repository, packaged as a zip file, stored on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and sent to the next stage of the pipeline.
* Amazon S3 to store the pipeline artifact. This is the template that defines the deployment environment used by the deployment stage after a successful build of the application.
* AWS CodeBuild to manage the building of an updated Docker image of the application on a container. CodeBuild connects to AWS Systems Manager, which automates the following build functions:
** Provision of a temporary Amazon EC2 instance in the default virtural private cloud (VPC).
** Retrieval of artifacts from Amazon S3.
** Building of a new Docker container image from the source code. 
** Publication of the new container image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR).
* Amazon ECR to host Docker container images.
* AWS CodeDeploy to create a new task definition that points to the newly-built Docker container image and updates the Amazon ECS service to use the new task definition.
Amazon ECS to initiate a deployment by fetching the new Docker container from Amazon ECR and restarting the service.

//[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
