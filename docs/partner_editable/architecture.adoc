.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* An AWS CodePipeline with source, build, and deploy stages.
//TODO mention AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodeDeploy
* An S3 bucket for holding artifacts.
* A temporary Amazon EC2 instance within the default VPC.
* An AWS Systems Manager automation document to launch the temporary Amazon EC2 instance and execute the Docker build on the instance.
* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) to hold the MSBuild container image.
//TODO is "MSBuild container image" = "Docker image with MSBuild 2017 for building .NET Framework"?

//[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
