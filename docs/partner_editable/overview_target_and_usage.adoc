This guide provides instructions for deploying a .NET Framework continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for developers who are looking for a deployment pipeline to implement CI/CD for their .NET Framework workloads hosted on Amazon ECS. Using this highly-scalable reference architecture enables them to rapidly and reliably deliver features and updates. There are no build servers to manage, and customers only pay for what they use.
