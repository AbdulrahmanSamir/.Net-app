## .NET Framework CI/CD for Amazon ECS

.NET Framework is a managed execution environment for applications that provides memory management, class libraries, versioning, and other software development tools.

![Quick Start Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-dotnetfx-ecs-cicd/main/docs/images/architecture_diagram.png)

This Quick Start builds a .NET Framework CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous deployment) environment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud to provide a pipeline for .NET Framework workloads. It can perform the following functions:

- Fetch the latest source code and save it to a source artifact store.
- Automatically build the application.
- Deploy the application to the target environment.

The Quick Start is for developers who are looking for a deployment pipeline to implement CI/CD for their .NET Framework workloads on AWS. It includes AWS CloudFormation templates that set up the CI/CD environment in about 30 minutes.

For architectural details, step-by-step instructions, and customization options, see the [deployment guide](https://aws-quickstart.github.io/quickstart-dotnetfx-ecs-cicd/).
